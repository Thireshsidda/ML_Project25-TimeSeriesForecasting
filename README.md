# ML_Project25-TimeSeriesForecasting

### Time Series Forecasting - LSTM Model for Prediction
This project demonstrates a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on historical data to learn patterns and predict future values in a sequence.

### LSTM Networks

LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture well-suited for time series forecasting. They can capture long-term dependencies within data sequences.

### Project Implementation

##### Data Preparation:
The code defines a function prepare_data to transform a time series into sequences of input and output features.

For example, a sequence length of 3 (n_steps) would use the past 3 data points to predict the next value.


##### Model Building:
A sequential LSTM model is created using the Keras library.

The model has two LSTM layers with 50 units each, followed by a dense output layer with one unit for single-step prediction.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (mse) loss function.


##### Model Training:
The model is trained on the prepared sequences for a specified number of epochs (iterations).


##### Prediction:
The code defines a function to generate predictions for future time steps.

It starts with a seed sequence of the last few data points in the original series.

The model predicts the next value based on the seed sequence.

The predicted value is then appended to the seed sequence, and the model is used to predict the next value again.

This process continues to generate predictions for a specified number of future time steps.

### Running the Script

Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed (numpy, tensorflow).

Place the script (time_series_forecasting.py) in a directory.

Run the script from the command line:
```
Bash
python time_series_forecasting.py
```
This will print the predicted values for the next 10 days and plot the predicted values along with the original data.

### Limitations
This is a basic example using a single LSTM layer. More complex architectures and hyperparameter tuning can improve performance.

Real-world time series data may exhibit seasonality or trends that require additional techniques for accurate forecasting.


### Further Exploration
Explore different LSTM architectures (stacked layers, bidirectional LSTMs).

Experiment with various hyperparameters (number of layers, units, learning rate).

Apply the model to different time series datasets (financial markets, sensor data).

Integrate the model into a real-world application for forecasting sales, inventory, or resource usage.
